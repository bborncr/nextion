NOTE: The examples use Software Serial to communicate with the Nextion.

However, Hardware Serial can be used also:

In the file Nextion.h

Comment out the following code (line 47): 

`#define USE_SOFTWARE_SERIAL`

Remove the lines:

`#include <SoftwareSerial.h>`

`SoftwareSerial nextion(2, 3);// Nextion TX to pin 2 and RX to pin 3 of Arduino`

Add the following define to assign a hardware serial port to "nextion":

`#define nextion Serial1`

Note that you can replace "Serial1" with Serial or Serial2 or whatever Serial ports your particular Arduino has.

If you are using an Arduino with only one hardware serial port (like the Arduino UNO) and want to use hardware serial you will have to use "#define nextion Serial" AND will need to remove all code that uses Serial for debugging. If you leave your Serial.print() commands in this case they will send data to the Nextion.
